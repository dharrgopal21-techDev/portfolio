      <p>
        I'm a Java Full Stack Developer with 8+ years of hands-on experience building reliable, scalable applications that solve real business problems. I enjoy understanding how systems work end-to-end from backend services to user-facing applications and turning complex requirements into clean, maintainable solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My core focus is Java and Spring Boot on the backend, combined with Angular and React on the frontend, working extensively with REST APIs and microservices architectures. I've supported and deployed applications in AWS and GCP environments, and I follow best practices around code quality, performance, and maintainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've spent most of my career working in Agile teams, collaborating closely with developers, testers, and product owners. I value clear communication, shared ownership, and continuous improvement, and I'm always looking for better ways to build and deliver software.
